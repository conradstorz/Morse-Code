# Morse-Code
Python code to play with string manipulation and encode/decode Morse Code strings

I first proposed this as a project to share with the SIG DerbyPy on 12/22/2015

The proposal is to develop Python code following TDD principals that will take strings
and encode/decode to/from Morse Code. 

As a second goal, the ability to encode/decode Morse Code
to/from audio files would be developed.

This is a learning experience. There are many sources around the Internet providing these services.
The purpose of this exercise is to improve coding skills not just find the answer someone else has
already worked out.
